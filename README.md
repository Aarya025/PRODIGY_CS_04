# Simple Keylogger ⌨️

## Overview
The Simple Keylogger is a Python-based tool designed to capture and log keystrokes on a computer. This project aims to demonstrate basic keylogging techniques for educational purposes and enhance your understanding of keyboard input monitoring.

## Features
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures all keyboard input in real-time.
- **File Output**: Logs captured keystrokes to a specified text file.
- **Stealth Operation**: Runs in the background without disrupting the user experience.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for this implementation.
- **Pynput**: A Python library used to monitor keyboard events.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Simple-Keylogger.git
   cd Simple-Keylogger
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

pip install pynput
Run the Program: You can run the program directly using Python:

python keylogger.py
Usage
Start the Keylogger: Run the script to start capturing keystrokes.
Stop the Keylogger: Terminate the script to stop logging. The captured keystrokes will be saved to the specified log file.
Important Note
This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Use it ethically and responsibly. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can lead to severe legal consequences.
Example Output
Captured keystrokes will be saved in a file named log.txt:
